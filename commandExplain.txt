*commit is like save points. it helps to go back or undo changes if we wish.

git log //detailed history of commits.
git log --oneline //to show the commits.
git log --oneline --graph

git reset --hard HEAD~1 //this will take you one step back(last commit (saved point));

git status -s //shows untracked->staged->updated file in the repo.

//branching
-----------
git branch feature/searchbar  //you can keep "feature/searchbar" as whatever you want.

//switch to specific branch

git switch feature/searchbar 

//it makes a duplicate/copy of main branch that changes reflects only on that specific branch.

//merging (you should be on main branch).
git merge feature/searchbar   //that changes in the branch will be merge with main.
                              *chances for occuring conflict.
                              merging types -fast forward merge, three way merge.
                              ff merge: changing the head location to the latest one.
                              three way: merging main and branch file that becomes new file.

//deleting branch
git branch -d feature/searchbar

git branch -C feature/footer  //this will create a branch named and switch to that branch.

*stash
